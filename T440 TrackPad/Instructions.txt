Run the .command file and all the proper changes will be made.

This .command file will:

- Remove VoodooPS2Controller.kext from /Library/Extensions, /EFI/ESP/CLOVER/kexts/Other/, and /EFI/ESP/CLOVER/kexts/System/

- Remove SSDT-VPS2.aml from /EFI/ESP/CLOVER/ACPI/patched

- Install ApplePS2SmartTouchPad.kext to /Library/Extensions, /EFI/ESP/CLOVER/kexts/Other/, and /EFI/ESP/CLOVER/kexts/System/

- Install SSDT-ASTP.aml to /EFI/ESP/CLOVER/ACPI/patched

- Repair all required permissions and system kextcache

The purpose of this configuration is to provide users who've replaced the 3 button trackpad in their Lenovo T450 with the one button clickpad from
the Lenovo T440 with a kext thats much better suited for that particular hardware. It also repairs the buttons which control brightness through the use
of SSDT-ASTP.aml as this is required for proper configuration of the keys that control brightness functionality.

**** MAKE SURE THE EFI PARTITION WHERE CLOVER RESIDES IS MOUNTED BEFORE RUNNING THE .command FILE ***
