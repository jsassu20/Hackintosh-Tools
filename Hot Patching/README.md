# Hot Patched Configuration Files

My T450 Hot Patched method. This configuration should be universal across all Broadwell based ThinkPad devices and probably most Broadwell based hackintosh setups with minor modifications needed.

#

### dsl folder
 
- Collection of dsl files which can be used to add to the Hot Patched method for specific purposes. Make sure you understand whats going on before using them.

#

### off folder

#

### config.plist

- Configuration file to be used with this configuration.

#

### .aml files

- Each of these files has a particular purpose in the Hot Patching method. They are the central files which this method revolves around and their purpose is to make changes to the ASL codebase which controls hardware functionality in the macOS kernel base.
